# Dual-EL payment-lane testnet (two lanes, two roots)

> This fork adds a **second execution lane** to Arc. Each node runs **1 consensus layer (Malachite) + 2
> execution layers (reth)** — a general **EVM lane** and a lean **payment lane** — and **every block
> commits two state roots**. The CL builds, validates, and finalizes *both* ELs each block; all
> validators re-execute both lanes and must agree on both roots.

   Malachite BFT (4 validators): ordered heights, one commit certificate per height
            │                         │
   ConsensusBlock(N)          ConsensusBlock(N+1)
   ├ execution_payload ─parentHash→ execution_payload      ← EVM lane  (its own hash chain)
   ├ payment_payload   ─parentHash→ payment_payload        ← payment lane (its own hash chain)
   └ proposer signature
```

## Prerequisites
- Linux + Docker (compose v2), ≥8 cores, ≥16 GB RAM, ≥80 GB free disk.
- **Node.js 22** (`nvm install 22 && nvm use 22`) — Node 18 breaks genesis.
- **Rust** (rustup, picks up `rust-toolchain.toml`), **clang + libclang-dev**, **Foundry** (`.foundry-version`).

## 1. Build (Docker images for both ELs + the dual-EL CL, plus the testnet manager)
```bash
make build-docker          # builds arc_execution:latest + arc_consensus:latest (BUILD_PROFILE=dev)
cargo build --bin quake    # quake embeds the dual-EL docker-compose template
cargo build --release --bin spammer   # load generator
```

## 2. Start the 4-node testnet (each node: 1 CL + 1 EVM-EL)
```bash
nvm use 22
cargo run --bin quake -- -f crates/quake/scenarios/soak4.toml start -e 1000 --monitoring false
```
EVM ELs publish host ports **8545 / 8645 / 8745 / 8845** (http), `+1` ws, `+6` authrpc.

## 3. Add the second (payment) EL to every node
```bash
cp assets/localdev/payment-jwt.hex .quake/soak4/assets/
TESTNET=soak4 bash experiments/dual-el/launch-payment-els.sh
```
Payment ELs publish **19545 / 19645 / 19745 / 19845** (http), `+1` ws, `+6` authrpc. Each CL was
generated with `--payment-execution-endpoint=http://NODE_el_pay:8551` and connects automatically
(it retries until the payment EL is up). Within seconds both lanes advance in lockstep.

## 4. Verify (two lanes, two roots, all validators agree)
```bash
# both lanes advancing, in lockstep:
for p in 8645 19645; do cast block-number --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:$p; done

# cross-validator agreement at a settled height H (all four must print the SAME hash, per lane):
H=$(($(cast block-number --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:19645)-10))
for p in 19545 19645 19745 19845; do cast block $H --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:$p --json | jq -r .hash; done
```

## 5. Stress both lanes
```bash
# EVM lane:
target/release/spammer ws --targets ws://127.0.0.1:8646,ws://127.0.0.1:8746,ws://127.0.0.1:8846 \
  -r 300 -t 60 -a 500 -g 4 --mix transfer=100
# payment lane:
target/release/spammer ws --targets ws://127.0.0.1:19646,ws://127.0.0.1:19746,ws://127.0.0.1:19846 \
  -r 300 -t 60 -a 500 -g 4 --mix transfer=100
# fill blocks to the 100M gas limit with high-gas txs:
#   --mix guzzler=100 --guzzler-fn-weights "hash-loop=100@2000"
```

## 6. Soak / correctness monitor (liveness + cross-validator agreement + health, with continuous spam)
```bash
DUR=3600 RATE=300 bash experiments/dual-el/soak.sh      # 1h; DUR=86400 for 24h
```

## Teardown
```bash
docker ps -aq --filter name=validator | xargs -r docker rm -f
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/.quake":/q alpine rm -rf /q/soak4
```

> **Common gotchas** (full list in the runbook): a stray `anvil` on host `:8545` shadows validator1's
> EVM host port (the node still works — query it over the docker network); leftover blockscout
> containers from a monitored run can recreate the testnet dir as root (use `--monitoring false`);
> EL datadirs are root-owned, so clear with the throwaway-container `rm` above; start all 4 validators
> together from genesis (value-sync of a late joiner doesn't carry the payment lane in v0).

Arc is an open EVM-compatible layer 1 built on [Malachite](https://github.com/circlefin/malachite) consensus, delivering the performance and reliability needed to meet the new demands of the global internet economy. 

## Features

- **USDC as Gas** - Pay gas in USDC for low, predictable fees on any transaction  
- **Deterministic Sub-second Finality** - Near-instant settlement finality powered by Malachite BFT consensus engine  
- **Circle Platform Integration** - Integrates with Circle’s full-stack platform (e.g., USDC, Wallets, CCTP, Gateway) to help you go from prototype to production faster  
- **(Coming soon) Opt-in Configurable Privacy** - Native privacy tooling enables selective shielding of sensitive financial data while preserving auditability

## Documentation

- 🚀 **[Execution](crates/node/README.md)** - Execution binary and configuration

## Install and Run a Node

### Install

See [Installation](docs/installation.md) for how to obtain the Arc node
binaries or Docker images (pre-built, from source, or via Docker).

### Run

See [Running an Arc Node](docs/running-an-arc-node.md) for configuration and
startup (binaries or Docker Compose).

## Development

### Repository setup

Clone the repository (or pull the latest changes). This repository uses Git submodules; initialize and update them with:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**Tip:** To automatically fetch submodules on `git pull`, run in the repo root:

```bash
git config submodule.recurse true
git config fetch.recurseSubmodules on-demand
```

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
- [Protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf)

Install required tools on macOS with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install protobuf node yarn bufbuild/buf/buf

curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

**Note:** Hardhat only supports **even** Node.js versions (e.g., 20.x, 22.x). Odd versions like 25.x are not supported. See [Hardhat's Node.js support policy](https://v2.hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/reference/stability-guarantees#node.js-versions-support) for details.

Install JavaScript dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Build

Build the project:

```bash
make build
```

### Code Quality

Format and lint your code:

```bash
make lint
```

### Testing

The test suite includes unit tests, integration tests, contract tests, and smoke tests.

Run tests:

```bash
# Unit tests (Rust + linting)
make test-unit

# Integration tests
make test-it

# Contract tests (Solidity)
make test-unit-contract

# Smoke tests (end-to-end validation)
make smoke

# Run all tests
make test-all
```

### Coverage

Generate and view test coverage (requires [`cargo-llvm-cov`](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)):

```bash
# Install cargo-llvm-cov on macOS with Homebrew (one-time setup)
brew install cargo-llvm-cov

# Generate coverage for unit tests
make cov-unit

# Generate HTML report and open in browser
make cov-show
```

### Local Testnet

Launch a full local testnet with 5 execution nodes, 5 consensus nodes, plus Prometheus, Grafana, and Blockscout:

```bash
make testnet
```

**Note:** If your development environment requires installing custom CA certificates, you can add them to the `deployments/certs` directory. They must be PEM-encoded and have a `.crt` extension. They will be automatically installed into the Docker images at build time.

To export a certificate from your system's keychain (macOS):

```bash
security find-certificate -p -c '<cert name>' > deployments/certs/<cert name>.crt
```

Interact with the testnet:

```bash
# Send tx load (usage: make testnet-load RATE=1000 TIME=60)
make testnet-load

# Stop the testnet
make testnet-down

# Clean up all resources
make testnet-clean
```
