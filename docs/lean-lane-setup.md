# Running the lean payment lane on a fresh machine

The lean lane is **in this repo** — `crates/lean-native` (wire format + pool
integration) and `crates/lean-lane-node` (the node). They build against upstream
reth `v2.3.0` like the rest of the workspace, so **no reth fork is required**.
`~/reth-fork` remains only as the experiment history; nothing here depends on it.

## What a fresh machine needs

| need | how |
|---|---|
| Rust (per `rust-toolchain.toml`) | rustup |
| clang + libclang-dev | reth-mdbx bindgen (the EVM lane; the lean node itself has no C deps) |
| Docker | EVM lane CL/EL images (`make build-docker`) |
| Foundry (`.foundry-version`) | `cast`, used by governance + fund-file generation |
| Node ≥20.19 / 22.x (even) | genesis step only |

## Build (one command each)

```bash
cargo build --release -p lean-lane-node     # the lean lane node  (~1 min warm, ~10 min cold)
cargo build --release -p spammer            # load generator
make build-docker                           # EVM lane CL+EL images (long)
```

## Genesis funding

The node funds a fixed address set at genesis (`--fund-file`). It must be exactly
the accounts the spammer signs with — derivation `m/44'/60'/1'/0/{i}` from the
standard test mnemonic. Note the **`1'`**, not the usual `0'`.

```bash
./experiments/dual-el/gen-lean-fund.sh 800 ~/lean-fund.txt
```

## Run a node

```bash
./target/release/lean-lane-node run \
  --datadir ~/lean-lane/val1 --port 8560 --bind 0.0.0.0 --chain-id 1338 --shim \
  --peers http://<peer2>:8560,http://<peer3>:8560 \
  --fund-file ~/lean-fund.txt --fund-balance 10000000000000000000
```

`--shim` means the CL drives block production (`arc_buildBlock` / `arc_newBlock`);
without it the node self-drives, which is only useful for standalone benchmarks.
`--peers` is the gossip/backfill mesh — see the shim contract in
`docs/lean-lane-integration.md`.

## Point a CL at it

Per-validator environment (default off — without these the CL is byte-identical
to stock):

```
ARC_PAYMENT_LEAN_LANE=1
ARC_PAYMENT_LEAN_RPC=http://<this machine's lean node>:8560
ARC_PAYMENT_LEAN_BUDGET_GAS=150000000
ARC_PAYMENT_LEAN_PEER_RPCS=http://<all four lean nodes>:8560,...
```

Boot order matters: **start the lean node before the CL**. A CL that boots while
its lean node is down parks in "Manual intervention required" and never proposes
again (it costs ~25% of cadence and is invisible to agreement checks).

## Benchmark

```bash
./experiments/dual-el/lane-bench.sh lean 150000000 100 600   # lean lane, N=100, 10-min window
./experiments/dual-el/lane-bench.sh evm  75000000            # EVM lane
```

Defaults to the repo-local binary and `~/lean-fund.txt`; override with `LEAN_BIN`
and `FUND`. It carries the measurement protocol (container census, pool wipe
before CL recreate, chain-static check, corpus probe, per-machine corpus
generation, remote-effect verification, CL health gate, fullness on every row) —
extend this script rather than hand-rolling per-experiment shell.

## Still machine-specific (the remaining porting work)

`lane-bench.sh` and the fleet launchers hardcode this fleet's four tailscale
hostnames/IPs and `/home/papaduck` paths. To run elsewhere, lift `HOSTS`/`IPS`
and the datadir root into an env file. Single-machine runs need none of that.
