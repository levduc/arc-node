//! Proposer clock-skew gate for received proposals.
//!
//! When a proposal's header timestamp is more than
//! [`ARC_PROPOSER_CLOCK_SKEW_THRESHOLD_SECS`] ahead of local time, the gate
//! downgrades the node's prevote to `Invalid`. It only ever changes the vote:
//! the block's persisted (execution-only) validity is untouched, so a value that
//! later carries a commit certificate is still adopted via sync. Because the
//! `Invalid` travels with the `ProposedValue`, it also keeps the node from
//! deciding directly on that certificate — adoption goes around through sync.
//! Both the live-arrival path (`received_proposal_part`) and the buffered/
//! early-arrival path (`started_round`) apply the gate here.
//!
//! The threshold, the timestamp predicate, and the local-clock read live in this
//! module: the clock-skew judgment is a consensus-layer concern (the execution
//! layer no longer performs it).
